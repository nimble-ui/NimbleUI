# Contributing to NimbleUI

First of all, the NimbleUI project's core members would like to thank all contributors for their contributions to this project!

## How to Contribute

### Discussions

Discussions are mainly for community discussions about the project!
Every thread that is not in the `General` category is meant for discussing the development of the project!
Administrators will mark discussions as `off topic` and lock the discussion in question if it is not `General` discussions and not discussing the operations of this project.
The `General` category is where community members can chat with the core members and other community members.

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

With a few exceptions, the issue tracker is *exclusively* for reporting bugs and proposing features.
Each type of issue has a respective template, so the issue tracker can be dedicated for reporting bugs.

### Pull Requests

Unless the pull request is opened by a core member, contributors must ask permission before opening a pull request.
Contributor-opened pull requests can be opened if the bug report or feature request is related to the issue,
and a core member has granted permission to the contributor in question.

Contributors who's pull requests are successfuly merged will have their avatar on the repository's `Contributors` list and in the image below!
