# Code of Conduct

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to the following communication channels:
- Issues and pull requests
- Discussions
- Any other communication method for the following:
  - Development of software
  - Representing the NimbleUI community.

Any clarifications on scope can be asked in the Q&A.

## Standards of Communication

We expect all users to have constructive discussions between members,
and we expect members to gracefully accept other's viewpoints.

We will not accept the following:

- Harassment of individuals, groups, or other entities inside or outside the community
- Attempts to hurt the reputation(s) of others
- Being an inconvenience to other community members
  or obstructing activities relating to the development of NimbleUI
- Discriminatory behavior based on race, gender, disability, or any other attribute.

If you see misbehaviour, speak with the community's [Administrators](ADMINISTRATORS.md).

## Administrative Policies and Practices

Administrators will try to look for misconduct when possible, but it is up to the community's members to report misconduct; We would rather have one report too many than one too few.

Administrators will not take a report lightly; appropriate actions will be taken as needed, and the community member in question will be warned as deemed necessary by Administrators.
